                        <p> My name is Rodyll, or RJ. Born and raised from the small island of Guam, I am 
                            a recent graduate from University of Las Vegas Nevada with a B.S. in Computer Science.
                        </p>
                        <p> I've been developing programs with C++ since 2019 and have been learning
                            about other languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, and C through coursework and 
                            school projects. I am currently working as a cybersecurity intern at Guam Power Authority 
                            with previous experience as a technician at Velocity Esports Inc 
                            located at Town Square in Las Vegas, Nevada where I was responsible for maintaining and 
                            repairing arcade games and bowling machines. 
                        </p>
                        <p> I have interest in data analysis, machine learning, and problem solving, but I am 
                            more than willing to put in the time to learn about anything that would seem interesting 
                            to me. Thank you for taking a look at my website, please feel free to explore my other tabs. 
                        </p>
